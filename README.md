This is a Swift client for [Replicate].
It lets you run models from your Swift code,
and do various other things on Replicate.

To learn how to use it, [take a look at our guide to building a SwiftUI app with Replicate](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/swiftui).

## Usage

Grab your API token from [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account)
and pass it to `Client(token:)`:

```swift
import Foundation
import Replicate

let replicate = Replicate.Client(token: <#token#>)
```

> **Warning**
>
> Don't store secrets in code or any other resources bundled with your app.
> Instead, fetch them from CloudKit or another server and store them in the keychain.

You can run a model and get its output:

```swift
let output = try await replicate.run(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf",
    ["prompt": "a 19th century portrait of a wombat gentleman"]
)

print(output)
// ["https://replicate.com/api/models/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/files/50fcac81-865d-499e-81ac-49de0cb79264/out-0.png"]
```

Or fetch a model by name and create a prediction against its latest version:

```swift
let model = try await replicate.getModel("stability-ai/stable-diffusion")
if let latestVersion = model.latestVersion {
    let prompt = """
        a 19th century portrait of a wombat gentleman
    """
    let prediction = try await replicate.createPrediction(version: latestVersion.id,
                                                       input: ["prompt": "\(prompt)"],
                                                       wait: true)
    print(prediction.output)
    // ["https://replicate.com/api/models/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/files/50fcac81-865d-499e-81ac-49de0cb79264/out-0.png"]
}
```

Some models,
like [tencentarc/gfpgan](https://replicate.com/tencentarc/gfpgan),
receive images as inputs.
To pass a file as an input,
read the contents of the file into a `Data` object,
and use the `uriEncoded(mimeType:) helper method to create a URI-encoded string.

```swift
let model = try await replicate.getModel("tencentarc/gfpgan")
if let latestVersion = model.latestVersion {
    let data = try! Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/image.jpg"))
    let mimeType = "image/jpeg"
    let prediction = try await replicate.createPrediction(version: latestVersion.id,
                                                       input: ["img": "\(data.uriEncoded(mimeType: mimeType))"])
    print(prediction.output)
    // ["https://replicate.com/api/models/tencentarc/gfpgan/files/85f53415-0dc7-4703-891f-1e6f912119ad/output.png"]
}
```

You can start a model and run it in the background:

```swift
let model = replicate.getModel("kvfrans/clipdraw")

let prompt = """
    Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine
"""
var prediction = replicate.createPrediction(version: model.latestVersion!.id,
                                         input: ["prompt": "\(prompt)"])
print(prediction.status)
// "starting"

try await prediction.wait(with: replicate)
print(prediction.status)
// "succeeded"
```

You can cancel a running prediction:

```swift
let model = replicate.getModel("kvfrans/clipdraw")

let prompt = """
    Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine
"""
var prediction = replicate.createPrediction(version: model.latestVersion!.id,
                                            input: ["prompt": "\(prompt)"])
print(prediction.status)
// "starting"

try await prediction.cancel(with: replicate)
print(prediction.status)
// "canceled"
```

You can list all the predictions you've run:

```swift
var predictions: [Prediction] = []
var cursor: Replicate.Client.Pagination<Prediction>.Cursor?
let limit = 100

repeat {
    let page = try await replicate.getPredictions(cursor: cursor)
    predictions.append(contentsOf: page.results)
    cursor = page.next
} while predictions.count < limit && cursor != nil
```

## Adding `Replicate` as a Dependency

To use the `Replicate` library in a Swift project,
add it to the dependencies for your package and your target:

```swift
let package = Package(
    // name, platforms, products, etc.
    dependencies: [
        // other dependencies
        .package(url: "https://github.com/replicate/replicate-swift", from: "0.17.1"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "<target>", dependencies: [
            // other dependencies
            .product(name: "Replicate", package: "replicate-swift"),
        ]),
        // other targets
    ]
)
```
